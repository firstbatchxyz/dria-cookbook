URL Source: https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval

Markdown Content:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are powerful tools for building AI-powered question-answering applications. Creating a diverse dataset of question & answer pairs that includes complex queries will help you quickly evaluate your RAG pipeline and generate metrics.

Evaluation is crucial to understanding the performance of your RAG system and identifying areas for improvement. There are multiple parameters to consider when evaluating a RAG system, including but not limited to:

*   Embedding model choice
*   Retrieval method (BM25, VectorDB, hybrid)
*   Reranking strategy
*   Answer generation model
*   Chunking strategy

Synthetic baseline data can help you evaluate your RAG system's performance across these parameters.

This guide demonstrates how to evaluate RAG systems using synthetic data, providing a practical approach to testing and improving your implementation.

If you are in a hurry, you can jump straight to the [code implementation](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#code).

Setup[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#setup ""Permanent link"")
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before getting started, ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.

Set up your environment using conda:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-0-1)condacreate-nragpython=3.10condaactivaterag
```

Install the required dependencies:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-1-1)pipinstall-URAGatouilleinstructordriadatasets
```

#### For this cookbook, we'll work with HuggingFace [Docs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-ric/huggingface_doc) as our RAG dataset.[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#for-this-cookbook-well-work-with-huggingface-docs-as-our-rag-dataset ""Permanent link"")

### RAG Implementation[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#rag-implementation ""Permanent link"")

RAG is implemented in the `RAG` class using [RAGatouille](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille) as the backbone for retrieval, a library focuses on making ColBERT simple to use for developers.

We'll use the `instructor` library to interact with OpenAI's API for chat completions for structured outputs.

Code taken from Instructor's [cookbook](https://python.useinstructor.com/examples/exact_citations/#validation-method-validate_sources). Pydantic classes structures the responses returned from `OpenAI` API.

To implement the RAG pipeline, we'll use the `RAG` class:

#### The `RAG` Class[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#the-rag-class ""Permanent link"")

*   `rag`: RAGPretrainedModel for ColBERT based retrieval.
*   `client`: Instructor client to interact with OpenAI's API.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-1)import instructor
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-2)from ragatouille import RAGPretrainedModel
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-3)from openai import OpenAI
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-4)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-5)class RAG:
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-6)    def __init__(self, chunks):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-7)        self.rag = RAGPretrainedModel.from_pretrained(""colbert-ir/colbertv2.0"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-8)        self.index_path = self.rag.index(index_name=""my_index"", collection=chunks)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-2-9)        self.client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())
```

Now we need `search` and `answer` methods to complete RAG pipeline.

*   `search`: Retrieve relevant documents based on the query.
*   `answer`: Generate a response using the retrieved documents.

We'll use `QuestionAnswer` pydantic model to structure the data for validation and processing.

```

[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-3-23)        )
```

And that's it! We have a complete RAG pipeline ready for evaluation.

* * *

Generating Synthetic Data[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#generating-synthetic-data ""Permanent link"")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate the RAG pipeline, we need a diverse dataset of question-answer pairs based on the document chunks we processed earlier. Our objective is to generate two datasets:

1.  **Questions**: A set of questions based on the document chunks and different personas.
2.  **Multi-hop Questions**: A set of multi-hop questions that require reasoning across multiple document chunks.

### Generating QA Pairs[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#generating-qa-pairs ""Permanent link"")

We'll use the `QAPipeline` [class](https://docs.dria.co/factory/qa/) from `dria.factory` to generate question-answer pairs based on the document chunks.

#### The `QAPipeline` Class[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#the-qapipeline-class ""Permanent link"")

Import the `QAPipeline` class from `dria.factory`:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-4-1)from dria.factory import QAPipeline
```

We define our _simulation_ as:

> AI developers and researchers learning Huggingface. Some focus on fine-tuning and post-training, others on RAG systems, retrieval problems, image models, or dataset work.

Description of simulation determines the backstories for the generated questions.

Along with it, we specify the persona for the pipeline.

> A researcher that is concise and direct

Persona determines how answers are generated based on the context provided.

We'll use existing chunks as our context to generate questions.

Instead of using chunks directly, we are merging them as files, and using files as whole to boost pipelines ability to generate coherent questions.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-1)pipeline = QAPipeline(dria).build(
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-2)    simulation_description=""AI developers and researchers learning Huggingface. ""
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-3)                           ""Some focus on fine-tuning and post-training, others on RAG systems, ""
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-4)                           ""retrieval problems, image models, or dataset work."",
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-5)    num_samples=1,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-6)    persona=""A HuggingFace expert that is concise and direct"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-7)    chunks=file_chunks,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-5-8))
```

We can now execute the pipeline to generate question-answer pairs.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-1)async def run_qa_pipeline(dria: Dria, file_chunks):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-2)    await dria.initialize()
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-3)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-4)    pipeline = QAPipeline(dria).build(
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-5)        simulation_description=""AI developers and researchers learning Huggingface. ""
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-6)                               ""Some focus on fine-tuning and post-training, others on RAG systems, ""
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-7)                               ""retrieval problems, image models, or dataset work."",
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-8)        num_samples=1,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-9)        persona=""A HuggingFace expert that is concise and direct"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-10)        chunks=file_chunks,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-11)    )
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-12)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-6-13)    return await pipeline.execute(return_output=True)
```

### Generating Multi-hop Questions[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#generating-multi-hop-questions ""Permanent link"")

We'll use the `MultiHopQuestion` [class](https://docs.dria.co/factory/multihopqa/) from `dria.factory` to generate multi-hop questions that require reasoning across multiple document chunks.

#### The `MultiHopQuestion` Class[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#the-multihopquestion-class ""Permanent link"")

Unlike simple QA pairs, multi-hop questions require reasoning across multiple document chunks. `MultiHopQuestion` class is a Singleton, not a pipeline. It's a single atomic task so we'll use it with our `ParallelSingletonExecutor`.

Import the `MultiHopQuestion` class from `dria.factory`:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-7-1)from dria.factory import MultiHopQuestion
```

We'll initialize selected singleton and pass it to the `ParallelSingletonExecutor` for execution.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-8-1)singleton = MultiHopQuestion()
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-8-2)executor = ParallelSingletonExecutor(dria, singleton)
```

We set the model pools for the executor, publishing tasks to nodes that work with the specified models.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-9-1)executor.set_models([Model.GPT4O, Model.GEMINI_15_FLASH, Model.QWEN2_5_32B_FP16, Model.GEMINI_15_FLASH])
```

Then load the instructions for the executor. We'll randomly sample 3 chunks from each file to create multi-hop questions.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-10-1)executor.load_instructions([{""chunks"": random.sample(file_chunks, 3)} for _ in range(10)])
```

Here is the complete code to generate multi-hop questions:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-1)async def run_multihop_tasks(dria: Dria, file_chunks):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-2)    singleton = MultiHopQuestion()
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-3)    executor = ParallelSingletonExecutor(dria, singleton)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-4)    executor.set_models(
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-5)        [
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-6)            Model.QWEN2_5_72B_OR,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-7)            Model.GEMINI_15_PRO,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-8)            Model.GPT4O,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-9)            Model.ANTHROPIC_SONNET_3_5_OR,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-10)            Model.ANTHROPIC_HAIKU_3_5_OR,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-11)        ]
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-12)    )
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-13)    executor.load_instructions(
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-14)        [{""chunks"": random.sample(file_chunks, 3)} for _ in range(10)]
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-15)    )
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#__codelineno-11-16)    return await executor.run()
```

That's it for generating synthetic data for evaluation.

Evaluation[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#evaluation ""Permanent link"")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate the RAG pipeline, we need to compare the generated questions and answers with the ground truth.

### Evaluator Class[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#evaluator-class ""Permanent link"")

The `Evaluator` class uses the `instructor` library to interact with OpenAI's API for chat completions to evaluate the generated questions.

We'll use the `EvaluationResult` pydantic model to structure the data for validation and processing.

```

```

### Running the Evaluation pipeline[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/eval#running-the-evaluation-pipeline ""Permanent link"")

In this cookbook, we'll implement the [`Synthetic Preference Data Generation Using Meta's Llama 3.1 405B Instruct`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/blob/main/tutorials/synthetic-preference-data/synthetic_preference_data_generation_llama_3_1_405b.ipynb) data using Dria Network.

#### There are two steps in the Nvidia's example:[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#there-are-two-steps-in-the-nvidias-example ""Permanent link"")

*   _Synthetic Response Generation_: A domain specific input query will be provided by the developer - at which point Llama 3.1 405B Instruct will be leveraged to generate ~150 questions. Then, Llama 3.1 405B Instruct will be used to generated 2 responses for each question.
*   _Reward Model as a Judge_: Nemotron-4 340B Reward will be used to score the 2 responses per question to be used for further alignment training via NeMo Aligner.

Implementation[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#implementation ""Permanent link"")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall structure of the pipeline looks like this:

```
flowchart LR
    SeedTopic[Seed Topic] --> Topic1[Topic 1]
    SeedTopic --> Topic2[Topic 2]
    SeedTopic --> Topic3[Topic 3]
    SeedTopic --> Topic4[Topic 4]

    Topic1 --> Q1(( )):::node
    Topic2 --> Q2(( )):::node

```

1.  A seed `topic` is used to generate multiple `sub_topics`
2.  Each `sub_topic` is fed into `question` generation step
3.  The `questions` are then aggregated and scattered to `answer` generation step.
4.  The `answers` are then aggregated to produce the dataset.

### Setup[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#setup ""Permanent link"")

To start with implementation, we'll create a folder structure as follows:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-1)- nemotron_qa
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-2)    - topics
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-3)        - __init__.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-4)        - task.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-5)        - prompt.md
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-6)    - questions
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-7)        - __init__.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-8)        - task.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-9)        - prompt.md
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-10)    - answers
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-11)        - __init__.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-12)        - task.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-13)        - prompt.md
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-14)    - __init__.py
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-0-15)    - pipeline.py
```

Each directory is for a specific step in the pipeline. The `task.py` in each directory will contain the implementation of the step whereas `prompt.md` will contain the prompt for the step.

### Prompts[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#prompts ""Permanent link"")

From Nvidia's cookbook:

_Prompt for the first step: `NemotronSubtopicStep`_

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-1-1)Given a topic, generate a list of {{n_subtopics}} subtopics that are related to the topic.
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-1-2)The topic is: {{topic}}
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-1-3)The list must be without numbers, and without any description of the subtopics. 
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-1-4)The subtopics should be separated by a comma. There must be no other text than the list.
```

_Prompt for the second step: `NemotronQuestionStep`_

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-2-1)Given a topic, generate {{n_questions}} questions that could be asked about that topic. Your response should be in a list format.
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-2-2)The topic is: {{sub_topic}}
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-2-3)The list must be without numbers. 
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-2-4)The questions should be separated by a newline character. There must be no other text than the list.
```

_Prompt for the third step: `NemotronAnswerStep`_

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-3-1)Given a question, generate 2 responses that could be given to that question. Your response should be in a list format.
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-3-2)The question is: {{question}}
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-3-3)The list must be in the format:
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-3-4)RESPONSE A: Response A text here
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-3-5)RESPONSE B: Response B text here
```

Variables `{{n_subtopics}}`, `{{topic}}`, `{{n_questions}}`, `{{sub_topic}}`, `{{question}}` will be replaced with the actual values during the execution of the pipeline. Please note that variables are enclosed in double curly braces `{{}}`.

### Understanding the Flow of Data[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#understanding-the-flow-of-data ""Permanent link"")

It's important to note that prompts for each step has parameters that are passed from the previous step which creates a flow of data. Inputs for a step are defined in the prompt and are passed from the previous step or explicitly set as user input.

```
flowchart TD
    A[topic] -->|input| B[NemotronSubtopicStep]
    A2[n_subtopics] -->|input| B
    B --> C[sub_topic] -->|input| D[NemotronQuestionStep]
    C2[n_questions] -->|input| D
    D --> E[question] -->|input| F[NemotronAnswerStep]
    F --> G[output]
```

Variables in prompts define expected input values for the step. The values are passed from the previous step to the next step.

### Implementing the Steps[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-steps ""Permanent link"")

Dria pipelines consists of Steps, which are instances of `StepTemplate`. We'll define a `StepTemplate` for each step in the pipeline. Each step must implement the `create_workflow` abstractmethod which returns a `Workflow` object.

#### Implementing the `NemotronSubtopicStep`[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-nemotronsubtopicstep ""Permanent link"")

Let's first implement the `NemotronSubtopicStep` class. We'll use variables `topic` and `n_subtopics` in the prompt as input parameters for the step.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-4-1)class NemotronSubtopicStep(StepTemplate):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-4-2)    def create_workflow(self, topic: str, n_subtopics: str) -> Workflow:
```

The `create_workflow` method will return a `Workflow` object. We'll use `WorkflowBuilder` to create the workflow. The step will have a single `generative_step` in `Workflow` which will generate the subtopics.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-1)class NemotronSubtopicStep(StepTemplate):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-2)    def create_workflow(self, topic: str, n_subtopics: str) -> Workflow:
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-3)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-4)        builder = WorkflowBuilder(topic=topic, n_subtopics=n_subtopics)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-5)        builder.set_max_time(50)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-6)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-7)        builder.generative_step(
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-8)            id=""generate_subtopics"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-9)            path=get_abs_path(""prompt.md""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-10)            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-11)            outputs=[Write.new(""subtopics"")],
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-12)        )
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-13)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-14)        flow = [
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-15)            Edge(source=""generate_subtopics"", target=""_end""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-16)        ]
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-17)        builder.flow(flow)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-18)        builder.set_return_value(""subtopics"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-19)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-20)        return builder.build()
```

In order to determine how outputs of one step are passed as inputs to the next step, we'll define a `callback` method in the `NemotronSubtopicStep` class. The `callback` method will take the output of the step and return the input for the next step. Since the output of the step is a list of subtopics, step returns a list of `TaskInput` objects for the next step.

`NemotronSubtopicStep` is a `1->N` step, meaning it takes one input and produces multiple outputs. Therefore it's safe to use `step.output[0]` since we'll execute a single task to generate subtopics from a topic.

Creating a list of `TaskInput` objects for the next step results in executing **multiple tasks in parallel for the next step**.

Note that since inputs for next step are `sub_topic` and `n_questions`, we'll create a `TaskInput` object for each subtopic generated in the previous step.

```

```

#### Implementing the `NemotronQuestionStep`[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-nemotronquestionstep ""Permanent link"")

Implementation of `NemotronQuestionStep` and `NemotronAnswerStep` are similar.

```

```

Callback for `NemotronQuestionStep` would be different since it's a `N->N` Question step will receive multiple outputs and again distribute multiple inputs for the next step.

In order to achieve this, callback method will loop through `step.output` values, parse them and create a List of `TaskInput` objects for the next step. Because of how task is prompted, callback splits output by "","" to obtain the list of questions generated by a single task.

```

#### Implementing the `NemotronAnswerStep`[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-nemotronanswerstep ""Permanent link"")

[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-10-27)        return responses
```

That's it! We've created all the steps.

#### Building the Pipeline[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#building-the-pipeline ""Permanent link"")

Final step for implementing the pipeline is to connect the steps using `PipelineBuilder`. The `PipelineBuilder`requires a `Dria` instance.

We'll create a `NemotronQA` class to build the pipeline.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-11-1)class NemotronQA:
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-11-2)    def __init__(self, dria: Dria):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-11-3)        self.pipeline = PipelineBuilder(dria)
```

Since we have implemented three steps, we'll define a list of models for each step.

See [models](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/models) for the full list of available models.

We define a list of models which act as a `model pool` for the step. If there are 100 tasks within that step, available nodes that runs one of the models will execute the task asynchronously.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-1)class NemotronQA:
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-2)    def __init__(self, dria: Dria):
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-3)        self.pipeline = PipelineBuilder(dria)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-4)        self.models_list = [
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-5)            [Model.GPT4O],
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-6)            [
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-7)                Model.GPT4O_MINI,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-8)                Model.QWEN2_5_32B_FP16,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-9)                Model.GEMINI_15_FLASH,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-10)                Model.MIXTRAL_8_7B,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-11)                Model.QWEN2_5_7B_FP16,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-12)            ],
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-13)            [
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-14)                Model.O1_MINI,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-15)                Model.LLAMA3_1_8B_FP16,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-16)                Model.GPT4O,
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-17)            ],
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-12-18)        ]
```

We'll define a `build` method which will connect the steps to the pipeline.

External parameters for this pipeline (i.e the ones that are not generated) are pipelines set as the input parameters of `NemotronQA` pipeline.

Even though Pipeline has three external params, first step only requires `topic` and `n_subtopics` as input.

See the flow of data [section](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#understanding-the-flow-of-data)

That's why we are setting our pipeline input as `(topic=topic, n_subtopics=n_subtopics` and feeding n\_questions as a parameter to the first step.

`NemotronSubtopicStep` inputs this parameter to second step. See [subtopic callback](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-nemotronsubtopicstep).

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-1)    def build(self, topic: str, n_subtopics: str, n_questions: str) -> Pipeline:
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-2)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-3)        self.pipeline.input(topic=topic, n_subtopics=n_subtopics)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-4)        (
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-5)            self.pipeline
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-6)            << NemotronSubtopicStep(n_questions=n_questions)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-7)            .set_models(self.models_list[0])
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-8)            .custom()
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-9)        )
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-10)        self.pipeline << NemotronQuestionStep().set_models(self.models_list[1]).custom()
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-11)        self.pipeline << NemotronAnswerStep().set_models(self.models_list[2]).custom()
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-12)
[](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-13-13)        return self.pipeline.build()
```

Dria connects Steps to the pipeline using `<<` notation. The order of the steps determines the order of execution.

Phew, that's it! We've implemented the pipeline.

Running the Pipeline[¶](https://docs.dria.co/cookbook/nemotron_qa#running-the-pipeline ""Permanent link"")

This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes absorb sunlight, which drives the splitting of water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. This creates a proton gradient that powers the production of ATP. The light-independent reactions use the energy from ATP and NADPH (produced in the light-dependent reactions) to fix carbon dioxide from the air into glucose through a series of enzymatic reactions. This glucose serves as the primary energy source for the plant and can be used to synthesize other organic compounds necessary for growth and development. Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth, as it produces oxygen as a byproduct and forms the base of most food chains in ecosystems."",

It\u2019s like when a teacher gives you a worksheet, and you need to fill in certain blanks and you can't just write random things. The JSON Schema is sort of like that worksheet. It tells the model exactly what pieces of info need to be there (like all the answers you need to fill in), so it doesn\u2019t skip anything important. And, it stops the model from just making up weird answers (or invalid enum values, to be fancy) because it has to pick from what\u2019s allowed. It's kinda like having a multiple-choice test where you can only pick A, B, or C, not like, Z or something. So, it keeps everything on track and makes sure nothing's missing or made up!"",

","The provided text focuses on generating synthetic character data using the Dria platform and doesn't offer information about Databricks' role in securing health records or addressing concerns about clinic cleanliness.  Databricks is a data analytics platform; its security features would be relevant to protecting *data* stored within its system, but not directly to the physical security of a clinic or the transportation safety of a patient.

To ensure the safety and privacy of your health records, you should focus on:

* **HIPAA compliance:**  Confirm that Dr. Lee's clinic and any associated data storage systems are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States (or equivalent regulations in your country).  HIPAA mandates specific security and privacy practices for protecting Protected Health Information (PHI).

* **Data encryption:**  Inquire whether your health records are encrypted both in transit (during transmission) and at rest (while stored).  Encryption significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

* **Secure data storage:**  Understand where and how your health data is stored.  Reputable providers use secure servers and robust access controls.

* **Safe driving practices:**  Focus on safe driving habits to mitigate risks during your commutes to the clinic.

* **Clinic hygiene:** While Databricks is irrelevant to this, you can directly address your concerns about the clinic's cleanliness by communicating them to Dr. Lee or clinic management.


In short, Databricks is not the solution for your concerns about physical safety and clinic hygiene.  The security of your electronic health records, however, *could* be improved by using a HIPAA-compliant system that leverages technologies like encryption and access controls.  Whether Databricks is used in that system is a separate question, and would depend on how Dr. Lee's clinic manages its data."

","Yes, Databricks' data analysis capabilities could potentially be used to identify patterns in Medicaid healthcare facility quality ratings. Databricks is a powerful platform for large-scale data processing and analytics, and it offers a range of tools for data analysis, machine learning, and data exploration. Here’s how it could be applied to your scenario:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: First, you would need to collect data on Medicaid healthcare facility quality ratings, which might include metrics such as cleanliness, patient outcomes, and other relevant factors. This data might be available from public datasets or through Medicaid reporting.

2. **Data Processing**: Using Databricks, you can preprocess and clean the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis. This might involve handling missing values, normalizing data, and enriching the dataset with additional contextual information, such as patient demographics or facility locations.

3. **Pattern Identification**: Leveraging the machine learning libraries and tools available in Databricks, you could perform analyses to identify patterns and trends in the data. Techniques like clustering, anomaly detection, or predictive modeling could shed light on facilities with consistently poor cleanliness records.

4. **Geospatial Analysis**: Databricks has support for geospatial data, which would enable you to analyze the proximity of these facilities to specific patient populations or regions. This could help in identifying facilities that are close to you or other specific patient groups.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Finally, Databricks can be used to create visualizations and reports that make it easier to communicate your findings. Interactive dashboards and visual reports can highlight key patterns and support decision-making.

By using Databricks in this way, you could potentially identify facilities with poor performance and advocate for changes or improvements, thereby contributing to better healthcare outcomes in your area."

Singletons are pre-built task templates that perform specific functions using a standardized structure. Each singleton is designed as a single instance that handles a specific task using Pydantic models for input validation and output formatting.

### Factory[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#factory ""Permanent link"")

Dria’s Factory offers various ready-to-use Singletons for different scenarios, easily compatible with a `DatasetGenerator` object. For more specific needs, however, creating your own Singleton is recommended.

Here's a basic example of how to use a singleton. Code below uses the `Simple` singleton from library which takes a prompt and executes it.

```

Writing Singletons[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#writing-singletons ""Permanent link"")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dria's factory is limited, therefore writing a Singleton can adapt Dria Network to any problem at hand.

### Basic Structure[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#basic-structure ""Permanent link"")

A singleton consists of three main components:

1.  Input fields (using Pydantic Fields)
2.  Output schema (using Pydantic BaseModel)
3.  Workflow and callback methods

We can start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the input fields and output schema.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-2-1)from dria.factory.utilities import get_abs_path
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-2-2)from dria.factory.workflows.template import SingletonTemplate
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-2-3)from dria.models import TaskResult
```

First step is to create a class that inherits from `SingletonTemplate` and define the input fields.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-3-1)class ValidatePrediction(SingletonTemplate):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-3-2)    # Input fields
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-3-3)    prediction: str = Field(..., description=""The predicted answer to be evaluated"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-3-4)    correct_answer: str = Field(
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-3-5)        ..., description=""The correct answer to compare against""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-3-6)    )
```

`SingletonTemplate` is a base class that provides the necessary functionality to create pre-built tasks. Next step is to create the output schema.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-4-1)class ValidationOutput(BaseModel):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-4-2)    prediction: str = Field(..., description=""The prediction result."")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-4-3)    correct_answer: str = Field(..., description=""The correct answer."")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-4-4)    validation: bool = Field(..., description=""Validation result (True/False)"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-4-5)    model: str = Field(..., description=""Model used for validation"")
```

Output schema is attached to the singleton with built-in `OutputSchema` attribute.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-1)class ValidatePrediction(SingletonTemplate):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-2)    # Input fields
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-3)    prediction: str = Field(..., description=""The predicted answer to be evaluated"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-4)    correct_answer: str = Field(
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-5)        ..., description=""The correct answer to compare against""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-6)    )
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-7)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-8)    # Output schema
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-5-9)    OutputSchema = ValidationOutput
```

Singleton class has two abstrat methods that need to be implemented: `workflow` and `callback`.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-6-1)def workflow(self) -> Workflow
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-6-2)def callback(self, result: List[TaskResult]) -> List[ValidationOutput]
```

See [workflows](https://docs.dria.co/workflows/) for more information on how to implement workflows.

The `workflow` method defines the task to be executed and `callback` method processes the result.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/singletons#__codelineno-7-1)    def workflow(self) -> Workflow:

Since Dria supports multiple models, [structured outputs](https://docs.dria.co/structured_outputs/) are not forced. But can be added through `schema` field of `generative_step`. If not, the format and parsing is up to the prompt you provided to the task.

This is the implemented prompt for `Validator`

Markdown Content:
Pipelines are used to generate complex outputs by combining multiple [workflows](https://docs.dria.co/workflows/). Key feature is to utilize asynchronous processing to execute multiple workflows in parallel and connect them in a sequence.

#### Understanding Pipelines[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#understanding-pipelines ""Permanent link"")

Pipelines are a sequence of workflows that are executed in a specific order. Each workflow can have multiple steps, and the output of one step can be used as input for the next step. Let's think of a Question Answer pipeline where the first step is to generate a question and the second step is to find the answer to the question.

Normally in a synchronous environment, the output of the first step is used as input for the second step. _But what if we need to create 100 questions and find their answers?_

We need Dria network to execute each instruction in parallel yet to create answers, we need the questions.

#### Implementing Pipelines[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#implementing-pipelines ""Permanent link"")

The `Pipeline` class is used to define the list of workflows, their corresponding models and the input data.

A pipeline consists of Steps, which are instances of `StepTemplate`.

Let's define a two-step pipeline by implementing `FirstPipelineStep` and `SecondPipelineStep`. Steps must implement the `create_workflow` abstractmethod which returns a `Workflow` object.

```

[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-0-6)        pass
```

##### Implementing the first step[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#implementing-the-first-step ""Permanent link"")

For clarification, let's implement the `FirstPipelineStep` class to create variations for an instruction.

```

[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-1-26)        return workflow
```

`FirstPipelineStep` generates 5 variations of the given instruction.

Instruction:

```

##### Implementing the second step[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#implementing-the-second-step ""Permanent link"")

For the second step, `SecondPipelineStep`, we will use the output of the first step as input. Second step will execute each instruction and return the output.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-1)class SecondPipelineStep(StepTemplate):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-2)    def create_workflow(self, instruction: str) -> Workflow:

[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-12)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-13)        flow = [Edge(source=""execute_instruction"", target=""_end"")]
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-14)        builder.flow(flow)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-15)        builder.set_return_value(""output"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-16)        workflow = builder.build()
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-3-17)        return workflow
```

Created steps are connected to a pipeline through `PipelineBuilder`. `BasicPipeline` has two steps: `FirstPipelineStep` and `SecondPipelineStep` which are instances of `StepTemplate`.

We use `<<` notation to add multiple steps to the pipeline and determine the order of execution.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-1)from dria.client import Dria
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-2)from dria.pipelines import Pipeline, PipelineBuilder
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-3)class BasicPipeline:
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-4)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-5)    def __init__(self, dria: Dria):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-6)        self.pipeline = PipelineBuilder(dria)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-7)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-8)    def build(self, instruction: str) -> Pipeline:
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-9)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-10)        self.pipeline.input(instruction=instruction)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-11)        self.pipeline << FirstPipelineStep().scatter() << SecondPipelineStep()
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-4-12)        return self.pipeline.build()
```

Instead looping through variations generated in the first step, and executing them one-by-one, we use special `scatter` callback to execute them in parallel. Pipeline will automatically handle the parallel execution of the steps by parsing the json output and sending each instruction as a seperate task to network. In order to achieve this, `FirstPipelineStep` must output a valid JSON deserializable list.

Finally we set the input instruction using the `input` method. and build the pipeline

#### Inputs[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#inputs ""Permanent link"")

Pipelines can have multiple inputs. Inputs are defined using the `input` method of the `PipelineBuilder` class.

There are pratically two ways to define inputs:

##### Using \*\*kwargs:[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#using-kwargs ""Permanent link"")

This is useful if pipeline has a single input for the start.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-5-1)self.pipeline.input(instruction=instruction)
```

##### Using lists:[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#using-lists ""Permanent link"")

This is useful if pipeline has multiple inputs as starting point. For a list of instructions:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-6-1)[""Write a haiku"",""Write a sonnet"",""Write a limerick""]
```

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-7-1)self.pipeline.input([{""instruction"": instruction} for instruction in instructions])
```

#### Callbacks[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#callbacks ""Permanent link"")

Callbacks are executed after a step is finished. Dria provides three built-in callbacks:

1.  `scatter`: 1-N mapping of input to output. Used to execute multiple tasks in parallel. Suitable when a step output is a list.
2.  `broadcast`: 1-N mapping of input to output. Used to duplicate the input to multiple tasks. Suitable when a step output is a single value.
3.  `aggregate`: N-1 mapping of input to output. Used to combine multiple outputs into a single output. Suitable when a step output is a list.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-8-1)self.pipeline << FirstPipelineStep().scatter() << SecondPipelineStep()
```

_Custom Callbacks_: You can define custom callbacks by implementing the `callback` method for `StepTemplate` class.

Custom callback takes a `Step` object as input and returns a `TaskInput` or `List[TaskInput]`. Custom callbacks enable design of custom input-output matching between steps of the pipeline. Here is an example of a custom callback:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-1)def callback(self, step: ""Step"") -> Union[List[TaskInput], TaskInput]:
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-2)""""""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-3)    Only to use as the last callback
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-4)    Args:
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-5)        step:
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-6)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-7)    Returns:
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-8)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-9)    """"""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-10)    # flatten list of lists
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-11)    outputs = [parse_json(o.result) for o in step.output]
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-12)    flattened = [item for sublist in outputs for item in sublist]
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/pipelines#__codelineno-9-13)    return TaskInput(**{""subtopics"": flattened})
```

Callback above flattens the list of lists and returns a single `TaskInput` object. An important point to note is that custom callbacks keys should match the keys of the input of the next step in the pipeline. For our case, the next step should have a key `subtopics` in its input.
","Yes, a system like Dria's pipelines could potentially help streamline your Medicaid paperwork and appointment scheduling. 

### How Dria's Pipelines Can Help:

1. **Automating Workflow**: Pipelines can be designed to automate the process of gathering necessary information for your Medicaid application. For example, a pipeline could generate a list of required documents and information based on your health issues and circumstances.

2. **Parallel Processing**: Since Dria's pipelines utilize asynchronous processing, multiple tasks can be executed in parallel. This means that while one part of the system is gathering paperwork, another part can be scheduling appointments for you, thus saving time.

3. **Sequential Steps**: Pipelines can link workflows in a sequence. For instance, after your paperwork is generated, the next step could automatically submit it, and the subsequent step could handle appointment scheduling based on your availability.

4. **Custom Workflows**: You can customize the pipelines to meet your specific needs, such as prioritizing urgent medical appointments or ensuring all paperwork is submitted by certain deadlines.

5. **Simplification of Processes**: By using a defined set of workflows within the pipeline, you could simplify the complex tasks of navigating Medicaid-related paperwork and scheduling, making the entire experience more user-friendly.

Overall, by implementing a system similar to Dria's pipelines for managing your Medicaid paperwork and appointments, you could potentially reduce the time and effort required to navigate the healthcare system, allowing you to focus more on your health and well-being."

Markdown Content:
Workflows are the instruction sets within a `Task`, allowing Dria nodes to breakdown complex tasks into smaller tasks. There maybe cases Singletons and Pipelines won't cover all the requirements of a task, in such cases, custom workflows come in handy. Dria SDK provides a way to create workflows through `dria_workflows` package.

A workflow consists of steps that interact with LLMs and I/O memory. Each step reads inputs from memory, generates text, and writes outputs back to memory. Workflows enable inter-step communication via [memory](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#memory-operations).

Creating a Workflow[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#creating-a-workflow ""Permanent link"")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workflows define the execution flow of tasks involving Large Language Models (LLMs).

Key components of a `Workflow`: - Configuration (config): An object containing settings like maximum steps, time limits, and tools. - Steps: A list of steps defining the individual units of work in the workflow. - Flow: A list specifying the execution order and conditional logic between tasks. - Return Value: A memory key indicating what value to return at the end of the workflow.

* * *

_`dria_workflows` is a Python package that simplifies the creation of workflows for Dria nodes. It's a dependency of the Dria SDK._

You can install it using pip for experimenting:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-0-1)pipinstalldria-workflows
```

* * *

In Dria, you create a `WorkflowBuilder` instance to start building your workflow:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-1-1)from dria_workflows import WorkflowBuilder
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-1-2)builder = WorkflowBuilder()
```

The configuration settings control the workflow’s execution parameters. You can set them using methods on the WorkflowBuilder instance.

`max_steps`: The maximum number of steps the workflow can execute.

`max_time`: The maximum time (in seconds) the workflow can run.

`max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens the LLM can generate.

These are limitations to prevent infinite loops or excessive resource usage. You can set them as follows:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-2-1)builder.set_max_steps(5)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-2-2)builder.set_max_time(100)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-2-3)builder.set_max_tokens(750)
```

Dria nodes provides several built-in tools that is included in your workflow by default. Tools include: - Search: Tools for searching and retrieving data. - Scrape: Tools for scraping data from the web. - Stock: Tool for retrieving stock data.

#### Steps[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#steps ""Permanent link"")

Each step describes a task in the workflow. Here is a simple workflow with a single step:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-1)from dria_workflows import WorkflowBuilder, Operator, Write
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-2)builder = WorkflowBuilder()
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-3)builder.generative_step(
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-4)    id=""task_id"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-5)    prompt=""What is 2+2?"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-6)    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-7)    outputs=[Write.new(""result"")],
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-3-8))
```

Let's break down the workflow step:

*   Create a step named `task_id`
*   Use the prompt ""What is 2+2?"" as your instruction
*   Set the operator to `Operator.GENERATION` for text generation
*   Define the output to write the result to the memory key `result`

[_Memory_](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#memory-operations) is a crucial component of workflows. It allows inter-step data transfer.

#### _Step types_[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#step-types ""Permanent link"")

There are two types of steps in a workflow:

`generative_step()` -\> Steps that generate text using an LLM. - operator `Operator` - GENERATION: Generates text using an LLM. - FUNCTION\_CALLING: Used for calling built-in [functions](https://docs.dria.co/functions/). Will execute the function and return the result. - FUNCTION\_CALLING\_RAW: Used for calling built-in or custom functions. Will return a function call without executing it. - prompt `str`: The prompt for the LLM. - path `str`: The path to a markdown file containing the prompt. - id `str`: The unique ID for the step.

`search_step()`: Steps that perform a search operation through the file system. - search\_query `str`: The query to search for. - id `str`: The unique ID for the step.

> Search is a built-in functionality of Dria nodes. Each node has a file system (vectorDB) that stores data for semantic search. Searchable data is inserted through `Insert` [output](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#memory-operations) type.

Memory Operations[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#memory-operations ""Permanent link"")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory operations allow tasks to read from and write to different storage mechanisms: cache, stack, and file system. Cache is a _KV cache_. Stack is a _LIFO stack_. File system is a _vectorDB_ for semantic search.

#### Inputs[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#inputs ""Permanent link"")

Before interacting with LLM, steps read inputs from memory and replace variables written `{{history}}` in prompts with actual values. It serves as a template engine like [jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja).

*   Read: Reads a value from the cache.
*   Pop: Pops the last value from a stack.
*   Peek: Peeks at a value (with index) in a stack.
*   GetAll: Retrieves all values from a stack.
*   Search: Performs a semantic search in the file system.

Code examples

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-1)from dria_workflows import Read, GetAll, Peek, Pop, Search
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-2)inputs=[
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-3)    Read.new(key=""user_input"", required=True),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-4)    GetAll.new(key=""history"", required=False),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-5)    Peek.new(key=""last_input"", index=0, required=False),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-6)    Pop.new(key=""last_output"", required=False),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-7)    Search.new(query=""search_query"", required=True),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-4-8)]
```

`required` field in inputs specifies if the input is mandatory for the task, forcing executor to halt if not found.

#### Outputs[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#outputs ""Permanent link"")

After step is executed, results are written back to memory for future steps to use.

*   Write: Writes a value to the cache.
*   Push: Pushes a value onto a stack.
*   Insert: Inserts a value into the file system.

Code Example

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-5-1)from dria_workflows import Write, Push, Insert
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-5-2)outputs=[
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-5-3)    Write.new(key=""processed_input""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-5-4)    Push.new(key=""input_history""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-5-5)    Insert.new(key=""search_query""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-5-6)]
```

Flows[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#flows ""Permanent link"")
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps define the execution flow between tasks, including conditional logic. Use the flow method to set up the steps:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-6-1)from dria_workflows import Edge
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-6-2)flow = [
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-6-3)    Edge(source=""task_a"", target=""task_b""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-6-4)    Edge(source=""task_b"", target=""_end""),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-6-5)]
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-6-6)builder.flow(flow)
```

*   source: The ID of the source task.
*   target: The ID of the target task.
*   fallback (optional): The ID of the task to jump to if the condition is not met.
*   condition (optional): A condition to evaluate before moving to the target task.
*   \_end: A special task ID indicating the end of the workflow.

#### Conditions[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#conditions ""Permanent link"")

You can add conditions to steps to control the flow based on certain criteria. _Defining a Condition_

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-1)from dria_workflows import ConditionBuilder, Read, Expression
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-2)condition=ConditionBuilder.build(
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-3)    input=Read.new(key=""validation_result"", required=True),
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-4)    expression=Expression.EQUAL,
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-5)    expected=""Yes"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-6)    target_if_not=""task_a"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-7-7))
```

*   input: The input to evaluate.
*   expression: The comparison operator (e.g., Expression.EQUAL).
*   expected: The expected value to compare against.
*   target\_if\_not: The task to jump to if the condition is not met.

Example with Condition

### Example Workflow[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#example-workflow ""Permanent link"")

We will create a workflow that:

```
1.  Generates random variables based on a simulation description.
2.  Validates the generated variables.
3.  If validation fails, it regenerates the variables.
```

_See the prompts_: [Random Variable Generation](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dria-sdk/blob/master/dria/factory/persona/random_variables/prompt.md) [Validation](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dria-sdk/blob/master/dria/factory/persona/random_variables/validate.md)

Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  Initialize the Workflow Builder

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-9-1)from dria_workflows import WorkflowBuilder
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-9-2)simulation_description = ""Describe your simulation here.""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-9-3)builder = WorkflowBuilder(simulation_description=simulation_description)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/workflows#__codelineno-9-4)builder.set_max_time(90)

URL Source: https://docs.dria.co/how-to/tasks

Markdown Content:
Tasks are a fundamental concept in the Dria network. They represent units of work that are executed by nodes in the network. Understanding how tasks work is crucial for effectively using the Dria system.

### What is a Task?[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/tasks#what-is-a-task ""Permanent link"")

A task in Dria consists of a [workflow](https://docs.dria.co/workflows/) and a set of [models](https://docs.dria.co/models/).

Tasks are executed asynchronously by nodes in the Dria network. When you create a task, you're essentially publishing it to the network for execution.

```
flowchart LR
    A[Dria SDK] -- Tasks --> B[Dria Knowledge Network]
    B -- Results --> A
```

Nodes in the network listens to P2P messages and execute tasks based on their capabilities and availability. We can think each [compute-node](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dkn-compute-node) as processor in [LLM OS](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1723140519554105733). They have memory, tools, and a model to execute tasks.

**Key Features of Tasks**

1.  **Model Selection**: You can specify which models you want to assign your task to. This allows for flexibility in choosing the most appropriate model for your specific needs.
    
2.  **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks are published to the network and executed by available nodes. This asynchronous nature allows for efficient distribution of work across the network.
    
3.  **Result Retrieval**: After a task is executed, results are published back to the network.
    
4.  **Scalability**: There is no limit to the number of tasks you can publish to the network, allowing for highly scalable operations.
    

### Sending Tasks[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/tasks#sending-tasks ""Permanent link"")

In this example, we are using `Simple` task, one of the built-in tasks that takes prompt and executes it on a model. See [Singletons](https://docs.dria.co/singletons/) for more details.

### Lifecycle of a Task[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/tasks#lifecycle-of-a-task ""Permanent link"")

*   Task Creation: You create a task by specifying a workflow and models.
*   Task Publication: The task is published to the network for execution.
*   Task Execution: Nodes that run one of the selected models execute the task asynchronously.
*   Result Retrieval: After execution, the result is published back to the network.
*   Result Polling: SDK polls the network to retrieve the result.
*   Task Completion: The task is marked as completed once the result is retrieved.

### Format for Training[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/dria_datasets_exports#format-for-training ""Permanent link"")

DriaDataset enables [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index) ready data exports for multiple training setups.

The `Formatter` class is used to convert a dataset into a format that can be used by a specific trainer. Data generated by Dria Network can be transformed into training-ready data using `Formatter`

#### Format Types[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/dria_datasets_exports#format-types ""Permanent link"")

The `Formatter` class supports the following format types:

*   Standard
*   Conversational

and following subtypes for each format type:

1.  LANGUAGE\_MODELING
2.  PROMPT\_ONLY
3.  PROMPT\_COMPLETION
4.  PREFERENCE
5.  UNPAIRED\_PREFERENCE

#### HuggingFace TRL Expected Dataset Formats[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/dria_datasets_exports#huggingface-trl-expected-dataset-formats ""Permanent link"")

HuggingFace's TRL is a framework to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step.

Dria allows you to convert the generated data into the expected dataset [format](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/dataset_formats) for each trainer in the TRL framework. Enabling seamless plug-n-play with HuggingFace's TRL.

Here is an example exporting MagPie data in `CONVERSATIONAL_PROMPT_COMPLETION` format. First create dataset and generate data.

URL Source: https://docs.dria.co/how-to/selecting_models

Markdown Content:
Dria Network is a network of LLMs. When a task is published to the network, you can specify which models you want to assign your task to.

> See [models](https://docs.dria.co/models/)

`Model` enum provides a list of models that you can use in your tasks.

`DatasetGenerator.generate()` has `models`param to assign models to your task.

Following task will be executed by `LLAMA3_1_8B_FP16` model. If the model is not available within network, SDK will poll the network until it finds an available `LLAMA3_1_8B_FP16` model.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/selecting_models#__codelineno-1-1)DatasetGenerator(dataset=dataset).generate(
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/selecting_models#__codelineno-1-2)    instructions=instructions, singletons=prompter, models=Model.LLAMA3_1_8B_FP16
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/selecting_models#__codelineno-1-3))
```

**Model Availability?**

Dria Network consists of multiple nodes, each running one or more available models. When a task is published, nodes with the selected model execute the task asynchronously.

For example, if the network has 100 `Llama3.2-3B` models, publishing a task with the `Llama3.2-3B` model will be handled by one of those models. Publishing 100 tasks will distribute each to one of the 100 available models. However, if you publish a 101st task, task will wait in queue until a `Llama3.2-3B` model becomes available.

**Singe Task, Multiple Models**

Dria SDK enables you to publish a single task to multiple models. This is useful when you want to compare the results of different models on the same task. Following example uses same instruction with different available open-source LLM and returns the results.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/selecting_models#__codelineno-2-1)instructions = [{""topic"": ""Decentralized synthetic data""}, {""topic"": ""Decentralized synthetic data""}]

[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/selecting_models#__codelineno-2-5))
```

You can also select providers as your models.

","Databricks can leverage synthetic data to enhance your personalized healthcare experience by using tools like the Dria Dataset framework to create data that simulates real-world scenarios while maintaining privacy and ethical standards. Here are some ways this can be achieved:

1. **Personalized Simulation:** Synthetic data can be designed to reflect the unique needs and characteristics of patients. For a Native Hawaiian woman balancing education and a complex pregnancy, data can be generated to simulate similar patient profiles, ensuring that analytics and healthcare strategies are tailored to your specific context.

2. **Culturally Relevant Data:** By incorporating cultural, geographic, and demographic factors into synthetic data generation, healthcare models can consider the unique needs of Native Hawaiian communities. This can help in developing culturally sensitive healthcare interventions and educational support.

3. **Data Privacy and Security:** Using synthetic data allows for the safeguarding of personal health information while still providing useful insights. This ensures that your privacy is maintained while healthcare providers can still access comprehensive and relevant data sets.

4. **Complex Health Conditions:** Synthetic data can model the complexities of managing education alongside a high-risk pregnancy. This can help healthcare providers understand potential health interventions and educational accommodations that might be required.

5. **Monitoring and Predictive Analysis:** Through synthetic data, Databricks can develop predictive models that anticipate complications or support requirements specific to high-risk pregnancies within the Native Hawaiian population. This can lead to proactive healthcare management and resource allocation.

6. **Flexible Data Management:** Using frameworks like Dria Dataset, Databricks can initialize and manage datasets flexibly, ensuring that they continuously improve as more relevant information becomes available, and as your healthcare needs evolve during your pregnancy and educational journey.

Overall, by leveraging synthetic data, Databricks can work with healthcare providers to create a more holistic, personalized, and secure healthcare experience designed around your unique lifestyle and cultural needs."

Markdown Content:
`enrich` provides powerful data enrichment capabilities that allow you to enrich your existing datasets by generating new fields through Dria. This helps you build richer data representations for analytics, machine learning models, or other downstream tasks.

Usage[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/data_enrichment#usage ""Permanent link"")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Define a Schema:** Create a Pydantic model to describe the output fields you want to generate.
    
2.  **Create a Prompt:** Write a descriptive prompt with placeholders matching your schema fields. The prompt guides the model on how to transform or analyze the data.
    
3.  **Run Enrichment:** Use Dria's `enrich` method to process your dataset.

How It Works[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/data_enrichment#how-it-works ""Permanent link"")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Schema Definition**: We use Pydantic's `BaseModel` to define the structure of our enriched data. The `SummarizedContent` class specifies that we want to keep both the original text and its summary.
    
2.  **Prompt Creation**: The `Prompt` class is initialized with:
    
    *   An input parameter `{{text}}` for given field which should already in as a field in your dataset.
    *   The `SummarizedContent` schema that defines the expected additional field your dataset.
3.  **Enrichment Process**: The `enrich` method:
    
    *   Takes each record from your dataset
    *   Applies the given prompt
    *   Updates the dataset with the enriched information

*   Enhance large text corpora with metadata for improved search, filtering, and analytics.
*   Gain a more holistic understanding of textual data by combining multiple analytical layers into a single enriched result.
*   More rapidly process and categorize large volumes of unstructured textual information, making it easier to identify trends, common issues, or frequently mentioned concepts.
*   Enhance upstream and downstream workflows: for instance, use the enriched fields to quickly filter content by sentiment, run targeted analyses on certain entities, or cluster documents by their main themes.
","Databricks can leverage data enrichment to improve the analysis of patient care outcomes and address challenges of service quality in Medicaid facilities by following these steps:

1. **Define Relevant Schemas**: Use schemas to define the structure of enriched data fields that are important for analyzing patient care outcomes. For example, you could define schema fields such as `care_quality_score`, `common_conditions`, `frequent_complaints`, and `overall_satisfaction`.

2. **Data Integration**: Integrate diverse data sources typically involved in Medicaid facilities, such as electronic health records (EHRs), patient feedback surveys, and service usage reports. This provides a comprehensive dataset for enrichment.

3. **Create Analytical Prompts**: Develop prompts that extract meaningful insights from the data. For instance, you could create prompts to determine patient sentiment based on feedback, extract key themes from patient complaints, and summarize care outcome data.

4. **Conduct Enrichment with Models**: Use machine learning models like Dria’s `enrich` method to apply the prompts across your dataset, creating new enriched fields. For example, analyze patient feedback to determine sentiment and extract frequently mentioned entities related to service quality.

5. **Visualization and Analysis**: Utilize tools within Databricks to visualize enriched data, identify trends, and conduct deeper analyses. This may include clustering patient feedback by common themes or filtering patient outcomes by satisfaction scores.

6. **Actionable Insights and Reporting**: Generate reports and dashboards that highlight areas of excellence and concern in service quality. This facilitates informed decision-making for stakeholders at Medicaid facilities, helping them prioritize interventions and resource allocation.

7. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine the analytical process by incorporating feedback and updated data. This ensures the enrichment process evolves with changing healthcare trends and challenges.

By employing these strategies, Databricks can significantly enhance the quality and depth of insights gleaned from Medicaid facility data, ultimately leading to improved patient care outcomes and service quality."

Custom Functions[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#custom-functions ""Permanent link"")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dria enables you to create custom functions (tools) that can be used in your workflows. These functions can be used to perform custom operations that are not natively supported by Dria.

Dria supports two types of custom functions:

*   `CustomTool`: A pydantic model that can be used in your workflows.

`CustomTool` will not be executed by Dria. Instead, it will be returned as a function call in the workflow output.

*   `HttpRequestTool`: An HTTP request tool that can be used to make HTTP requests in your workflows.

`HttpRequestTool` will be executed by Dria and the result will be returned in the workflow output.

#### CustomTool[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#customtool ""Permanent link"")

To create a custom function, you need to create a class that inherits from `CustomTool` and implement the `execute` method.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-1)from dria_workflows import CustomTool
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-2)from pydantic import Field
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-3)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-4)class SumTool(CustomTool):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-5)    name: str = ""calculator""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-6)    description: str = ""A tool sums integers""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-7)    lhs: int = Field(0, description=""Left hand side of sum"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-8)    rhs: int = Field(0, description=""Right hand side of sum"")
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-9)
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-10)    def execute(self, **kwargs):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-1-11)        return self.lhs + self.rhs
```

`name` and `description` are required fields that describe the custom function. For the rest of your custom function, you can define any number of fields that you need. If field has a default value, it means it's a required field.

To incorporate the custom function into your workflow, simple call `add_custom_tool` method on the `WorkflowBuilder` instance.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-2-1)builder = WorkflowBuilder()
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-2-2)builder.add_custom_tool(SumTool())
```

This would add the custom function to the list of available functions in your workflow.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-3-1)builder.generative_step(
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-3-2)    id=""sum"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-3-3)    prompt=f""What is {lhs} + {rhs}?"",
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-3-4)    operator=Operator.FUNCTION_CALLING_RAW,
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-3-5)    outputs=[Write.new(""call"")]
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-3-6))
```

Steps that incorporate custom functions should use `Operator.FUNCTION_CALLING_RAW` as the operator. This would force Dria Nodes to return the function call without executing it.

Below is a full example of a workflow that sums two numbers using a custom function:

#### HttpRequestTool[¶](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#httprequesttool ""Permanent link"")

`HttpRequestTool` is a tool that can be used to make HTTP requests in your workflows. Unlike `CustomTool`, `HttpRequestTool` will be executed by Dria Nodes and the result will be returned in the workflow output.

To create an `HttpRequestTool`, you need to create a class that inherits from `HttpRequestTool` and implement the `execute` method.

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-5-1)from dria_workflows import HttpRequestTool, HttpMethod
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-5-2)class PriceFeedTool(HttpRequestTool):
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-5-3)    name: str = ""PriceFeedRequest""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-5-4)    description: str = ""Fetches price feed from Gemini API""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-5-5)    url: str = ""https://api.gemini.com/v1/pricefeed""
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-5-6)    method: HttpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
```

An `HttpRequestTool` requires the following fields:

*   `name`: The name of the tool.
*   `description`: A description of the tool.
*   `url`: The URL to make the HTTP request to.
*   `method`: The HTTP method to use for the request.
*   `headers`: Optional headers to include in the request.
*   `body`: Optional body to include in the request.

A `HttpRequestTool` can be added to the workflow in the same way as a `CustomTool`. Here is an example of a workflow that fetches cryptocurrency prices using an `HttpRequestTool`:

```
[](https://docs.dria.co/how-to/functions#__codelineno-6-1)class PriceFeedTool(HttpRequestTool):

Structured outputs best explained in OpenAI's [blog post](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs):

> Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied JSON Schema, so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Dria Network supports structured outputs for providers including `OpenAI`, `Gemini` and `Ollama`. However, structured outputs are only supported by models that are capable of [function](https://docs.dria.co/functions/) calling.

Enabling structured outputs is simple. You just need to provide a schema to the `WorkflowBuilder` instance, rest will be handled by Dria SDK.

Batches (ParallelSingletonExecutor) is a way to run multiple instructions in parallel. This is useful when you have a large number of instructions to run and you want to run them concurrently.

To use Batches, you need to create a `Dria` client, a `Singleton` task, and a `ParallelSingletonExecutor` object.
