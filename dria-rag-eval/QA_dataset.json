Some focus on fine-tuning and post-training, others on RAG systems, retrieval problems, image models, or dataset work.\n\nDescription of simulation determines the backstories for the generated questions.\n\nAlong with it, we specify the persona for the pipeline.\n\n> A researcher that is concise and direct\n\nPersona determines how answers are generated based on the context provided.\n\nWe'll use existing chunks as our context to generate questions.\n\nInstead of using chunks directly, we are merging them as files, and using files as whole to boost pipelines ability to generate coherent questions.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-1)pipeline = QAPipeline(dria).build(\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-2)    simulation_description=\"AI developers and researchers learning Huggingface. \"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-3)                           \"Some focus on fine-tuning and post-training, others on RAG systems, \"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-4)                           \"retrieval problems, image models, or dataset work.\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-5)    num_samples=1,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-6)    persona=\"A HuggingFace expert that is concise and direct\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-7)    chunks=file_chunks,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-5-8))\n```\n\nWe can now execute the pipeline to generate question-answer pairs.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-1)async def run_qa_pipeline(dria: Dria, file_chunks):\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-2)    await dria.initialize()\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-3)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-4)    pipeline = QAPipeline(dria).build(\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-5)        simulation_description=\"AI developers and researchers learning Huggingface. \"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-6)                               \"Some focus on fine-tuning and post-training, others on RAG systems, \"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-7)                               \"retrieval problems, image models, or dataset work.\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-8)        num_samples=1,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-9)        persona=\"A HuggingFace expert that is concise and direct\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-10)        chunks=file_chunks,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-11)    )\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-12)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-6-13)    return await pipeline.execute(return_output=True)\n```\n\n### Generating Multi-hop Questions[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#generating-multi-hop-questions \"Permanent link\")\n\nWe'll use the `MultiHopQuestion` [class](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/factory\/multihopqa\/) from `dria.factory` to generate multi-hop questions that require reasoning across multiple document chunks.\n\n#### The `MultiHopQuestion` Class[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#the-multihopquestion-class \"Permanent link\")\n\nUnlike simple QA pairs, multi-hop questions require reasoning across multiple document chunks. `MultiHopQuestion` class is a Singleton, not a pipeline. It's a single atomic task so we'll use it with our `ParallelSingletonExecutor`.\n\nImport the `MultiHopQuestion` class from `dria.factory`:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-7-1)from dria.factory import MultiHopQuestion\n```\n\nWe'll initialize selected singleton and pass it to the `ParallelSingletonExecutor` for execution.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-8-1)singleton = MultiHopQuestion()\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-8-2)executor = ParallelSingletonExecutor(dria, singleton)\n```\n\nWe set the model pools for the executor, publishing tasks to nodes that work with the specified models.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-9-1)executor.set_models([Model.GPT4O, Model.GEMINI_15_FLASH, Model.QWEN2_5_32B_FP16, Model.GEMINI_15_FLASH])\n```\n\nThen load the instructions for the executor. We'll randomly sample 3 chunks from each file to create multi-hop questions.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-10-1)executor.load_instructions([{\"chunks\": random.sample(file_chunks, 3)} for _ in range(10)])\n```\n\nHere is the complete code to generate multi-hop questions:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-11-1)async def

truth.\n\n### Evaluator Class[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#evaluator-class \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe `Evaluator` class uses the `instructor` library to interact with OpenAI's API for chat completions to evaluate the generated questions.\n\nWe'll use the `EvaluationResult` pydantic model to structure the data for validation and processing.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-12-1)import instructor\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/eval#__codelineno-12-2)from pydantic import BaseModel,

Please note that variables are enclosed in double curly braces `{{}}`.\n\n### Understanding the Flow of Data[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#understanding-the-flow-of-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nIt's important to note that prompts for each step has parameters that are passed from the previous step which creates a flow of data. Inputs for a step are defined in the prompt and are passed from the previous step or explicitly set as user input.\n\n```\nflowchart TD\n    A[topic] -->|input| B[NemotronSubtopicStep]\n    A2[n_subtopics] -->|input| B\n    B --> C[sub_topic] -->|input| D[NemotronQuestionStep]\n    C2[n_questions] -->|input| D\n    D --> E[question] -->|input| F[NemotronAnswerStep]\n    F --> G[output]\n```\n\nVariables in prompts define expected input values for the step. The values are passed from the previous step to the next step.\n\n### Implementing the Steps[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\nDria pipelines consists of Steps, which are instances of `StepTemplate`. We'll define a `StepTemplate` for each step in the pipeline. Each step must implement the `create_workflow` abstractmethod which returns a `Workflow` object.\n\n#### Implementing the `NemotronSubtopicStep`[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#implementing-the-nemotronsubtopicstep \"Permanent link\")\n\nLet's first implement the `NemotronSubtopicStep` class. We'll use variables `topic` and `n_subtopics` in the prompt as input parameters for the step.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-4-1)class NemotronSubtopicStep(StepTemplate):\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-4-2)    def create_workflow(self, topic: str, n_subtopics: str) -> Workflow:\n```\n\nThe `create_workflow` method will return a `Workflow` object. We'll use `WorkflowBuilder` to create the workflow. The step will have a single `generative_step` in `Workflow` which will generate the subtopics.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-1)class NemotronSubtopicStep(StepTemplate):\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-2)    def create_workflow(self, topic: str, n_subtopics: str) -> Workflow:\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-3)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-4)        builder = WorkflowBuilder(topic=topic, n_subtopics=n_subtopics)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-5)        builder.set_max_time(50)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-6)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-7)        builder.generative_step(\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-8)            id=\"generate_subtopics\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-9)            path=get_abs_path(\"prompt.md\"),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-10)            operator=Operator.GENERATION,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-11)            outputs=[Write.new(\"subtopics\")],\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-12)        )\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-13)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-14)        flow = [\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-15)            Edge(source=\"generate_subtopics\", target=\"_end\"),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-16)        ]\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-17)        builder.flow(flow)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-18)        builder.set_return_value(\"subtopics\")\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-19)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/cookbook\/nemotron_qa#__codelineno-5-20)        return builder.build()\n```\n\nIn order to determine how outputs of one step are passed as inputs to the next step, we'll define a `callback` method in the `NemotronSubtopicStep` class. The `callback` method will take the output of the step and return the input for the next step.

During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes absorb sunlight, which drives the splitting of water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. This creates a proton gradient that powers the production of ATP. The light-independent reactions use the energy from ATP and NADPH (produced in the light-dependent reactions) to fix carbon dioxide from the air into glucose through a series of enzymatic reactions. This glucose serves as the primary energy source for the plant and can be used to synthesize other organic compounds necessary for growth and development.

Akira's childhood was marked by limited resources, but her curiosity and innate problem-solving skills helped her excel academically. After graduation, she struggled to find stable employment, often relying on friends to cover living expenses. The low paying jobs she landed forced her to prioritize, and she often put her health on the back burner, occasionally visiting the emergency room for bouts of poor health.

With her income still modest, she often relies on secondary diagnoses from other doctors, who are often more lenient than Dr. Brown. Her health is poor due to these factors, but she is usually satisfied with her healthcare service because of the prompt attention she receives. Like many in Neo-Tokyo, Akira is resourceful, often relying on technology to find ways to adapt and cope with her situation, which she finds both reassuring and occasionally overwhelming.

Databricks is a data analytics platform; its security features would be relevant to protecting *data* stored within its system, but not directly to the physical security of a clinic or the transportation safety of a patient.\n\nTo ensure the safety and privacy of your health records, you should focus on:\n\n* **HIPAA compliance:**  Confirm that Dr. Lee's clinic and any associated data storage systems are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States (or equivalent regulations in your country).  HIPAA mandates specific security and privacy practices for protecting Protected Health Information (PHI).\n\n* **Data encryption:**  Inquire whether your health records are encrypted both in transit (during transmission) and at rest (while stored).  Encryption significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n* **Secure data storage:**  Understand where and how your health data is stored.  Reputable providers use secure servers and robust access controls.\n\n* **Safe driving practices:**  Focus on safe driving habits to mitigate risks during your commutes to the clinic.\n\n* **Clinic hygiene:** While Databricks is irrelevant to this, you can directly address your concerns about the clinic's cleanliness by communicating them to Dr. Lee or clinic management.\n\n\nIn short, Databricks is not the solution for your concerns about physical safety and clinic hygiene.  The security of your electronic health records, however, *could* be improved by using a HIPAA-compliant system that leverages technologies like encryption and access controls.

Inputs are defined using the `input` method of the `PipelineBuilder` class.\n\nThere are pratically two ways to define inputs:\n\n##### Using \\*\\*kwargs:[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#using-kwargs \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is useful if pipeline has a single input for the start.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-5-1)self.pipeline.input(instruction=instruction)\n```\n\n##### Using lists:[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#using-lists \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is useful if pipeline has multiple inputs as starting point. For a list of instructions:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-6-1)[\"Write a haiku\",\"Write a sonnet\",\"Write a limerick\"]\n```\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-7-1)self.pipeline.input([{\"instruction\": instruction} for instruction in instructions])\n```\n\n#### Callbacks[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#callbacks \"Permanent link\")\n\nCallbacks are executed after a step is finished. Dria provides three built-in callbacks:\n\n1.  `scatter`: 1-N mapping of input to output. Used to execute multiple tasks in parallel. Suitable when a step output is a list.\n2.  `broadcast`: 1-N mapping of input to output. Used to duplicate the input to multiple tasks. Suitable when a step output is a single value.\n3.  `aggregate`: N-1 mapping of input to output. Used to combine multiple outputs into a single output. Suitable when a step output is a list.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-8-1)self.pipeline << FirstPipelineStep().scatter() << SecondPipelineStep()\n```\n\n_Custom Callbacks_: You can define custom callbacks by implementing the `callback` method for `StepTemplate` class.\n\nCustom callback takes a `Step` object as input and returns a `TaskInput` or `List[TaskInput]`. Custom callbacks enable design of custom input-output matching between steps of the pipeline. Here is an example of a custom callback:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-1)def callback(self, step: \"Step\") -> Union[List[TaskInput], TaskInput]:\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-2)\"\"\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-3)    Only to use as the last callback\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-4)    Args:\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-5)        step:\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-6)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-7)    Returns:\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-8)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-9)    \"\"\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-10)    # flatten list of lists\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-11)    outputs = [parse_json(o.result) for o in step.output]\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-12)    flattened = [item for sublist in outputs for item in sublist]\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/pipelines#__codelineno-9-13)    return TaskInput(**{\"subtopics\": flattened})\n```\n\nCallback above flattens the list of lists and returns a single `TaskInput` object. An important point to note is that custom callbacks keys should match the keys of the input of the next step in the pipeline. For our case, the next step should have a key `subtopics` in its input.\n","answer":"Yes, a system like Dria's pipelines could potentially help streamline your Medicaid paperwork and appointment scheduling. \n\n### How Dria's Pipelines Can Help:\n\n1. **Automating Workflow**: Pipelines can be designed to automate the process of gathering necessary information for your Medicaid application. For example, a pipeline could generate a list of required documents and information based on your health issues and circumstances.\n\n2. **Parallel Processing**: Since Dria's pipelines utilize asynchronous processing, multiple tasks can be executed in parallel. This means that while one part of the system is gathering paperwork, another part can be scheduling appointments for you, thus saving time.\n\n3. **Sequential Steps**: Pipelines can link workflows in a sequence. For instance, after your paperwork is generated, the next step could automatically submit it, and the subsequent step could handle appointment scheduling based on your availability.\n\n4. **Custom Workflows**: You can customize the pipelines to meet your specific needs, such as prioritizing urgent medical appointments or ensuring all paperwork is submitted by certain deadlines.\n\n5. **Simplification of Processes**: By using a defined set of workflows within the pipeline, you could simplify the complex tasks of navigating Medicaid-related paperwork and scheduling, making the entire experience more user-friendly.\n\nOverall, by implementing a system similar to Dria's pipelines for managing your Medicaid paperwork and appointments, you could potentially reduce the time and effort required to navigate the healthcare system, allowing you to focus more on your health and well-being."},{"persona":"At 42, Kai Ngata, a retired Native Hawaiian who once juggled college studies with a rewarding career, now faces frequent healthcare visits for unresolved health concerns, often frustrated by long wait times at the clinic 14 miles away, yet navigates the system with a discerning eye and moderate tech usage, reflecting a deep-rooted resilience and tenacity earned through life's twists and turns, supported by Medicaid and with the unwavering partnership of a beloved spouse by their side.","question":"Given my frequent healthcare visits and the long travel times to the clinic, could a Databricks solution help streamline my medical data access and appointment scheduling, perhaps by integrating with my Medicaid provider and allowing for easier communication with my doctors?","context":"Title: Custom Workflows within Dria Network\n\nURL Source: https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows\n\nMarkdown Content:\nWorkflows are the instruction sets within a `Task`, allowing Dria nodes to breakdown complex tasks into smaller tasks.

It's a dependency of the Dria SDK._\n\nYou can install it using pip for experimenting:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-0-1)pipinstalldria-workflows\n```\n\n* * *\n\nIn Dria, you create a `WorkflowBuilder` instance to start building your workflow:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-1-1)from dria_workflows import WorkflowBuilder\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-1-2)builder = WorkflowBuilder()\n```\n\nThe configuration settings control the workflow’s execution parameters. You can set them using methods on the WorkflowBuilder instance.\n\n`max_steps`: The maximum number of steps the workflow can execute.\n\n`max_time`: The maximum time (in seconds) the workflow can run.\n\n`max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens the LLM can generate.\n\nThese are limitations to prevent infinite loops or excessive resource usage. You can set them as follows:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-2-1)builder.set_max_steps(5)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-2-2)builder.set_max_time(100)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-2-3)builder.set_max_tokens(750)\n```\n\nDria nodes provides several built-in tools that is included in your workflow by default. Tools include: - Search: Tools for searching and retrieving data. - Scrape: Tools for scraping data from the web. - Stock: Tool for retrieving stock data.\n\n#### Steps[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#steps \"Permanent link\")\n\nEach step describes a task in the workflow. Here is a simple workflow with a single step:\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-1)from dria_workflows import WorkflowBuilder, Operator, Write\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-2)builder = WorkflowBuilder()\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-3)builder.generative_step(\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-4)    id=\"task_id\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-5)    prompt=\"What is 2+2?\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-6)    operator=Operator.GENERATION,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-7)    outputs=[Write.new(\"result\")],\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-3-8))\n```\n\nLet's break down the workflow step:\n\n*   Create a step named `task_id`\n*   Use the prompt \"What is 2+2?\" as your instruction\n*   Set the operator to `Operator.GENERATION` for text generation\n*   Define the output to write the result to the memory key `result`\n\n[_Memory_](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#memory-operations) is a crucial component of workflows. It allows inter-step data transfer.\n\n#### _Step types_[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#step-types \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two types of steps in a workflow:\n\n`generative_step()` -\\> Steps that generate text using an LLM. - operator `Operator` - GENERATION: Generates text using an LLM. - FUNCTION\\_CALLING: Used for calling built-in [functions](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/functions\/). Will execute the function and return the result. - FUNCTION\\_CALLING\\_RAW: Used for calling built-in or custom functions. Will return a function call without executing it. - prompt `str`: The prompt for the LLM. - path `str`: The path to a markdown file containing the prompt. - id `str`: The unique ID for the step.\n\n`search_step()`: Steps that perform a search operation through the file system. - search\\_query `str`: The query to search for. - id `str`: The unique ID for the step.\n\n> Search is a built-in functionality of Dria nodes. Each node has a file system (vectorDB) that stores data for semantic search. Searchable data is inserted through `Insert` [output](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#memory-operations) type.\n\nMemory Operations[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#memory-operations \"Permanent link\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMemory operations allow tasks to read from and write to different storage mechanisms: cache, stack, and file system. Cache is a _KV cache_. Stack is a _LIFO stack_. File system is a _vectorDB_ for semantic search.\n\n#### Inputs[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#inputs \"Permanent link\")\n\nBefore interacting with LLM, steps read inputs from memory and replace variables written `{{history}}` in prompts with actual values. It serves as a template engine like [jinja](https:\/\/github.com\/pallets\/jinja).\n\n*   Read: Reads a value from the cache.\n*   Pop: Pops the last value from a stack.\n*   Peek: Peeks at a value (with index) in a stack.\n*   GetAll: Retrieves all values from a stack.\n*   Search: Performs a semantic search in the file system.\n\nCode examples\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-1)from dria_workflows import Read, GetAll, Peek, Pop, Search\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-2)inputs=[\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-3)    Read.new(key=\"user_input\", required=True),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-4)    GetAll.new(key=\"history\", required=False),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-5)    Peek.new(key=\"last_input\", index=0, required=False),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-6)    Pop.new(key=\"last_output\", required=False),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-7)    Search.new(query=\"search_query\", required=True),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-4-8)]\n```\n\n`required` field in inputs specifies if the input is mandatory for the task, forcing executor to halt if not found.\n\n#### Outputs[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#outputs \"Permanent link\")\n\nAfter step is executed, results are written back to memory for future steps to use.\n\n*   Write: Writes a value to the cache.\n*   Push: Pushes a value onto a stack.\n*   Insert: Inserts a value into the file system.\n\nCode Example\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-5-1)from dria_workflows import Write, Push, Insert\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-5-2)outputs=[\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-5-3)    Write.new(key=\"processed_input\"),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-5-4)    Push.new(key=\"input_history\"),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-5-5)    Insert.new(key=\"search_query\"),\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#__codelineno-5-6)]\n```\n\nFlows[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/workflows#flows \"Permanent link\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteps define the execution flow between tasks, including conditional logic.

They represent units of work that are executed by nodes in the network. Understanding how tasks work is crucial for effectively using the Dria system.\n\n### What is a Task?[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/tasks#what-is-a-task \"Permanent link\")\n\nA task in Dria consists of a [workflow](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/workflows\/) and a set of [models](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/models\/).\n\nTasks are executed asynchronously by nodes in the Dria network. When you create a task, you're essentially publishing it to the network for execution.\n\n```\nflowchart LR\n    A[Dria SDK] -- Tasks --> B[Dria Knowledge Network]\n    B -- Results --> A\n```\n\nNodes in the network listens to P2P messages and execute tasks based on their capabilities and availability. We can think each [compute-node](https:\/\/github.com\/firstbatchxyz\/dkn-compute-node) as processor in [LLM OS](https:\/\/x.com\/karpathy\/status\/1723140519554105733). They have memory, tools, and a model to execute tasks.\n\n**Key Features of Tasks**\n\n1.  **Model Selection**: You can specify which models you want to assign your task to. This allows for flexibility in choosing the most appropriate model for your specific needs.\n    \n2.  **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks are published to the network and executed by available nodes. This asynchronous nature allows for efficient distribution of work across the network.\n    \n3.  **Result Retrieval**: After a task is executed, results are published back to the network.\n    \n4.  **Scalability**: There is no limit to the number of tasks you can publish to the network, allowing for highly scalable operations.\n    \n\n### Sending Tasks[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/tasks#sending-tasks \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn this example, we are using `Simple` task, one of the built-in tasks that takes prompt and executes it on a model.

Publishing 100 tasks will distribute each to one of the 100 available models. However, if you publish a 101st task, task will wait in queue until a `Llama3.2-3B` model becomes available.\n\n**Singe Task, Multiple Models**\n\nDria SDK enables you to publish a single task to multiple models.

For example, you could define schema fields such as `care_quality_score`, `common_conditions`, `frequent_complaints`, and `overall_satisfaction`.\n\n2. **Data Integration**: Integrate diverse data sources typically involved in Medicaid facilities, such as electronic health records (EHRs), patient feedback surveys, and service usage reports. This provides a comprehensive dataset for enrichment.\n\n3. **Create Analytical Prompts**: Develop prompts that extract meaningful insights from the data. For instance, you could create prompts to determine patient sentiment based on feedback, extract key themes from patient complaints, and summarize care outcome data.\n\n4. **Conduct Enrichment with Models**: Use machine learning models like Dria’s `enrich` method to apply the prompts across your dataset, creating new enriched fields. For example, analyze patient feedback to determine sentiment and extract frequently mentioned entities related to service quality.\n\n5. **Visualization and Analysis**: Utilize tools within Databricks to visualize enriched data, identify trends, and conduct deeper analyses. This may include clustering patient feedback by common themes or filtering patient outcomes by satisfaction scores.\n\n6. **Actionable Insights and Reporting**: Generate reports and dashboards that highlight areas of excellence and concern in service quality. This facilitates informed decision-making for stakeholders at Medicaid facilities, helping them prioritize interventions and resource allocation.\n\n7. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine the analytical process by incorporating feedback and updated data. This ensures the enrichment process evolves with changing healthcare trends and challenges.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Databricks can significantly enhance the quality and depth of insights gleaned from Medicaid facility data, ultimately leading to improved patient care outcomes and service quality."},{"persona":"John, a 42-year-old single male of diverse ethnicity, wields his Bachelor's degree and a lucrative career to navigate the intricacies of managing a chronic disease, frequently traveling 49 miles to consult the seemingly detached Dr. Smith – a journey fueled by his advanced tech-savvy approaches to healthcare, yet tainted by his dissatisfaction with the physician's demeanor despite the commendable quality of care, within an innovative sphere where AI engineers employ synthetic data technology like Dria to optimize healthcare outcomes.","question":"How can Databricks' advanced data processing and analytics capabilities support someone like me, who is tech-savvy and managing a chronic disease, in creating personalized healthcare insights or solutions using synthetic data tools like Dria?","context":"Title: Functions - Dria Docs\n\nURL Source: https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions\n\nMarkdown Content:\nDria Nodes provides several built-in tools that are included in your workflow by default.

These functions can be used to perform custom operations that are not natively supported by Dria.\n\nDria supports two types of custom functions:\n\n*   `CustomTool`: A pydantic model that can be used in your workflows.\n\n`CustomTool` will not be executed by Dria. Instead, it will be returned as a function call in the workflow output.\n\n*   `HttpRequestTool`: An HTTP request tool that can be used to make HTTP requests in your workflows.\n\n`HttpRequestTool` will be executed by Dria and the result will be returned in the workflow output.\n\n#### CustomTool[¶](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#customtool \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo create a custom function, you need to create a class that inherits from `CustomTool` and implement the `execute` method.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-1)from dria_workflows import CustomTool\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-2)from pydantic import Field\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-3)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-4)class SumTool(CustomTool):\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-5)    name: str = \"calculator\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-6)    description: str = \"A tool sums integers\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-7)    lhs: int = Field(0, description=\"Left hand side of sum\")\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-8)    rhs: int = Field(0, description=\"Right hand side of sum\")\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-9)\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-10)    def execute(self, **kwargs):\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-1-11)        return self.lhs + self.rhs\n```\n\n`name` and `description` are required fields that describe the custom function. For the rest of your custom function, you can define any number of fields that you need. If field has a default value, it means it's a required field.\n\nTo incorporate the custom function into your workflow, simple call `add_custom_tool` method on the `WorkflowBuilder` instance.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-2-1)builder = WorkflowBuilder()\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-2-2)builder.add_custom_tool(SumTool())\n```\n\nThis would add the custom function to the list of available functions in your workflow.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-3-1)builder.generative_step(\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-3-2)    id=\"sum\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-3-3)    prompt=f\"What is {lhs} + {rhs}?\",\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-3-4)    operator=Operator.FUNCTION_CALLING_RAW,\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-3-5)    outputs=[Write.new(\"call\")]\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-3-6))\n```\n\nSteps that incorporate custom functions should use `Operator.FUNCTION_CALLING_RAW` as the operator.

Unlike `CustomTool`, `HttpRequestTool` will be executed by Dria Nodes and the result will be returned in the workflow output.\n\nTo create an `HttpRequestTool`, you need to create a class that inherits from `HttpRequestTool` and implement the `execute` method.\n\n```\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-5-1)from dria_workflows import HttpRequestTool, HttpMethod\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-5-2)class PriceFeedTool(HttpRequestTool):\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-5-3)    name: str = \"PriceFeedRequest\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-5-4)    description: str = \"Fetches price feed from Gemini API\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-5-5)    url: str = \"https:\/\/api.gemini.com\/v1\/pricefeed\"\n[](https:\/\/docs.dria.co\/how-to\/functions#__codelineno-5-6)    method: HttpMethod = HttpMethod.GET\n```\n\nAn `HttpRequestTool` requires the following fields:\n\n*   `name`: The name of the tool.\n*   `description`: A description of the tool.\n*   `url`: The URL to make the HTTP request to.\n*   `method`: The HTTP method to use for the request.\n*   `headers`: Optional headers to include in the request.\n*   `body`: Optional body to include in the request.\n\nA `HttpRequestTool` can be added to the workflow in the same way as a `CustomTool`.
